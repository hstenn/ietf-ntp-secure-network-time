    <abstract>
      <t>The proposal specifies a means for NTP instances that can
      establish a TCP connection between themselves to create secure
      ephemeral keys.  With the known weaknesses of the public-key
      security protocol, Autokey, which is defined by <xref
      target="RFC5906">RFC 5906</xref>, a replacement for Autokey that
      supports at least Client/Server and Symmetric modes must be
      provided.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>From almost the beginning, NTP has provided a mechanism to
      authenticate an NTP packet.  To date, that mechanism is a
      Message Authentication Code, or MAC.  The MAC is comprised of
      two subfields, a 32-bit keyID and a signature.  A keyID with a
      value between 1 and 65535, inclusive, is a symmetric key.  A
      keyID with a value greater than 65535 is not provided by the
      symmetric key file, and has traditionally been negotiated
      ephemerally, with Autokey, defined by <xref target="RFC5906">RFC
      5906</xref>, being one example.</t>

      <t>The mechanism by which keys are exchanged between NTP
      instance can be thought of as a black-box exchange.  One of
      these black-box key exchange mechanisms is "the way the ntp.keys
      file containing symmetric keys is distributed."  Another way
      keys have been exchaned is via Autokey.</t>

      <t>This Secure Network Time proposal uses the NTP TCP Services
      mechanism to perform key exchange, follwed by negotiation of a
      keyID, a hash algorithm, and a secret key over a TLS connection.
      Once this has been done, each participant can use the keyID,
      hash algorithm, and secret key to provide MAC protection for NTP
      packets, using ephemeral keys that can be re-negotiated
      as-needed.</t>

      <t>Should additional security measures be desired, for example
      using a cookie as additional replay prevention, that can be
      easily provided.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Secure Network Time">
      <t>Secure Network Time uses "NTP TCP Services" to perform key
      exchange over a TLS connection, followed by an agreement on a
      keyID, hash algorithm, and a secret.  With the secure
      communication of a keyID, a cryptographically strong hash
      algorithm, and a secret of sufficient strength, we have an
      ephemeral key exchange mechanism that provides MAC
      authentication for NTP packets.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
